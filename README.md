The ability to see clearly is a necessity for every human being in the world. Some people
have colour blindness, and in some situations, these individuals may not even know that they have
the condition. Most people who are colour blind are able to see clearly, but they cannot identify
red, green, and blue light clearly. Very rarely there are some people who cannot see colour at all.
Colour blind people face many difficulties in daily life that ordinary people do not notice.
Nowadays there are many online simulators, computer monitors and software to assist the colour
blind as technology advances day by day. However real-time colour correction is still very
defective. Therefore, team PICO PRIDE aims to develop a colour correcting app that translates
the colours into the colours that the colour-blind person can see which is equal to the visual
representation of the original image in real-time. The concentration of this research is employing
the most efficient technologies to develop this colour correcting application.
